### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sankeerth Pradeep

Iâ€™m an engineer from Kerala, India, currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Mechatronics & Robotics in Germany. Iâ€™m driven by curiosity, hands-on learning, and a passion for turning ideas into reliable, real-world solutions. My motto: grow constantly, build boldly, and help others rise.

I enjoy building practical systems â€” from an ESP32-based XY pen plotter and functional robotic prototypes to publishing research that solves real challenges in agriculture and biomedical fields. With over 1.5 years of experience in a German-speaking environment (English C1 | German B1).

**Controls & Automation:** RSLogix 500 (Level 2 â€” tank filling, servo control, PID logic), Siemens TIA Portal (learning), EasyEDA  
**Programming Languages:** C, C++, Python, Linux Shell, Arduino IDE  
**CAD & Simulation:** Autodesk Fusion 360, ANSYS, Simulink, RobotStudio  
**Mindset:** Agile, organised, solution-focused, quick learner, team player

**Published research:**  
- Terrain-Adaptive Seed Sowing Robot â€” *AIP Conference Proceedings*, Best Paper Award @ ICAMST  
- Design & Structural Analysis of a Prosthetic Ankle-Foot â€” *Materials Today: Proceedings*

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning *advanced PLC/HMI programming and industrial automation*.  
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for *internship or working student opportunities* in automation, robotics, and mechatronic system development.
